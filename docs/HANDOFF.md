# Handoff: mdedit and the shared crates

Written 2026-11-13, updated the same day after phases 2 and 3. Read this first, then
`docs/PLAN.md` (goals, budgets, phases, feature roadmap) and `docs/DESIGN.md` (the design of
phase 1, and section 16 on editing and saving as built).

## 1. Where things are

Three public repositories under `Kaan88`, all MIT, all pushed and clean on `main`:

| Repository | What | Head on 2026-11-13 |
|---|---|---|
| `markdown-viewer-rs` | `mdview`, the Markdown viewer. Its own `docs/HANDOFF.md` describes it | `b4e1617` |
| `markdown-shared-rs` | Four crates both applications use | `e93719b` |
| `markdown-editor-rs` | `mdedit`, this repository | this commit |

The editor pins the shared repository by `rev` in its root `Cargo.toml`, since 2026-11-13 at
`e93719bf3bd37edc5570769a5850d22af3603ca5` (the watcher's `set_folders` and the tree's public
`watched_dirs`, which the editor does not use yet). The viewer pins it in `crates/core`,
`crates/render` and `bins/mdv-app`; check there which commit it is on.

On the Windows PC the three checkouts sit side by side in `C:\Users\kaank\Desktop`: `mv`,
`markdown-shared-rs`, `markdown-editor-rs`. Anywhere else, clone all three fresh. The viewer's
history was rewritten on 2026-11-12, so an older clone of it must be re-cloned, not pulled.

## 2. The user's rules

- **The goal for the editor (2026-11-12):** "as long as the app remains just as fast to open and
  work, implement useful features from notepad++." The agreed list and its order are in
  `docs/PLAN.md` under "Feature roadmap". Measure the budgets before and after each feature.
- The user approves the interface by looking at it. Screenshots and tests do not stand in for that.
- Report results plainly, including what was not run. Nothing counts as working on Windows until
  it has run on Windows.
- Commit and push as phases complete or when asked. There is no CI: run the tests yourself.
- On the Windows PC, launch a built `.exe` from Git Bash, not PowerShell (PowerShell refuses it as
  unsigned).
- The user asked for cheaper models where they do the job, and on 2026-11-13 said: no Opus
  subagents; the main session does that work itself. So the headless crates with a clear
  specification go to Sonnet subagents (each in its own git worktree, so their builds do not
  break each other), and the design, the shell, the reviews and the fixes stay in the main
  session.

## 3. What was done on 2026-11-12

**Shared crates** (plan: `markdown-shared-rs/docs/PLAN.md`, steps 0 to 3 done):

| Crate | Holds |
|---|---|
| `mdshared-text` | `Bitmap`, `TextEngine`, `shared_fonts` |
| `mdshared-highlight` | syntect set-up, whole-block highlighting (viewer), `incremental` line highlighter (editor) |
| `mdshared-ui` | `gfx` (`Painter`), `theme`, `menu`, `textfield`, `tree`, `keys`, `platform`, `glyph`, `scroll`, `chrome` (tabs, caption buttons), `pane`, `overlay` (bubbles, dialog frame), `window` (resize bands) |
| `mdshared-app` | `paths`, `files`, `recents`, `settings` (key=value layer), `single` (hand-over), `watch` |

The viewer re-exports them at their old paths. After every step the viewer's 43 `--shot` renders
were compared byte for byte with renders taken before the move, and all matched; its tests pass
(319 there, 74 in the shared repository, more than the 368 before the move because tests were
added). `mdview.exe` went from 7,439,872 to 7,457,280 bytes.

Not done for the shared code: step 4 (the window loop as a framework) was put off on purpose.
Each application has its own loop; design the shared one from the two. Step 5 (a tag) waits for
that.

**Editor.** Phase 0 spikes (`spikes/*/RESULTS.md`) and phase 1, the read-only editor: tabs,
scrolling, caret and selection by keyboard and mouse, copy, find with counter, go to line, zoom,
Files pane, recent files, session restore, reload on change, single instance, syntax colours,
encodings (UTF-8, UTF-16 by BOM, legacy code pages guessed with `chardetng`) and line endings in
the status bar. Typing does nothing yet.

| Crate | Holds |
|---|---|
| `crates/mdedit-core` | Loading, encodings, line endings, the rope buffer, display columns, selection, find. Headless |
| `crates/mdedit-highlight` | The highlight worker thread over `mdshared_highlight::incremental` |
| `bins/mdedit` | The shell: window loop, text view (`view.rs`, `view/`), chrome, panes, overlays, session, `--shot` |

Measured on the PC, release build (phase 1, after the fixes):

| | Budget | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| First frame, small file | under 100 ms | 84 to 104 ms across runs, median about 90 |
| First frame, 100 MB file | under 500 ms | 138 to 199 ms warm, 271 ms cold |
| Private memory, small file | under 30 MiB | 27.5 MiB |
| Private memory, 100 MB file | 125 MiB | 133 MiB, over by 8 MiB, left as it is |
| Scroll frame, p95 | under 4 ms | 0.8 to 1.5 ms |
| Idle CPU, focused window | zero | none measured |
| Exe | under 6 MB | 5.7 MB |

**2026-11-13: phases 2 and 3.** Editing and safe saving, as `docs/DESIGN.md` section 16
describes them. Two Sonnet subagents wrote the headless parts (`buffer.rs` `replace` and `Change`,
`edit.rs`, `history.rs`; `save.rs`), the main session wrote the shell around them and
`HighlightService::edit`. Figures are in `docs/PLAN.md` under "State": a keystroke reaches the
pixels in under 1 ms on the small and the 100 MB file, and the phase 1 budgets hold.

## 4. What has not been done or checked

- **The user has not looked at either application since these changes.** The editor was opened on
  their screen once; no feedback yet. Nothing about the interface is approved.
- Nothing interactive in the editor was tried by hand: selection, copy into another program, find,
  tabs (drag, middle click, menu), the Files pane, theme switch, reload when the file changes, a
  second launch handing over to the first.
- Of phases 2 and 3, by hand: nothing. Typing ran only through `--type-steps` (a real window,
  scripted keystrokes) and `--type`. Never pressed by a person: every editing key, dead keys and
  AltGr on the Turkish layout, cut and paste with another program, the three questions (Save
  changes, file changed on disk, reload and lose changes), Save as and its file dialog, closing
  the window with several modified tabs.
- `ReplaceFileW`'s fallback for file systems that do not support it (network shares, FAT) has
  not run. The code for other systems than Windows has not been built.
- A view request the highlight worker cannot finish inside one 8 ms slice from its start seems
  never to be answered (`mdedit-highlight`'s `work`, found while writing a test: 600 lines of Rust
  in one request timed out). Requests are a screen or three, so it has not shown, but a slow
  syntax (Markdown) on a tall window could stay uncoloured. Not investigated further.
- Undo steps are capped by the text they hold (64 MiB), not by their number.
- The first frame of a Markdown file was 125 ms in one run (`fixtures/sample.md`), over the
  100 ms budget set on `sample.rs`; whether phase 1 had that was not checked.
- The viewer's first-frame time and memory were not re-measured after the move to shared crates,
  and its installer was not rebuilt. The installed `mdview` on the PC is the build from before
  the move.
- Idle CPU with the editor's window unfocused was not measured.
- The input-method hand test (`spikes/ime/RESULTS.md`: Turkish Q dead keys and AltGr, a CJK IME)
  was not done. Phase 2 depends on what it shows.
- Linux: nothing in the shared crates or the editor has been built there.
- The editor's small-file first frame sits at the edge of its budget: about 60 ms of it is
  syntect start-up before the first colours.

## 5. Decisions the user has not confirmed

These were made to keep moving and are easy to undo:

1. **`panic = "abort"`** in the editor's release profile. It saved 0.9 MB and brought the exe
   under 6 MB. A panic on any thread ends the process, and since 2026-11-13 there is unsaved
   text to lose. The viewer uses `unwind`. Unwinding alone would not save the text either; what
   does is unsaved-session restore (roadmap item 3), so that is the place to settle this.
2. **Crate names** `mdshared-*` (the shared plan called them placeholders).
3. **Step 4 put off**, as above.
4. **`mdshared-app` created** (open decision 1 of the shared plan, taken as it recommended).
5. Open in `docs/PLAN.md` and untouched: the editor's name, one installer or two, word-wrap
   default, Markdown conveniences.
6. Made on 2026-11-13 for phases 2 and 3: Tab inserts a tab character (no spaces option); the
   unsaved mark is a bullet before the file name; a file with replaced bytes is read-only;
   saving runs on the UI thread; the layout cache is keyed by line content; the IME stays off
   until phase 5; no New file command (a document has a path from the start).

## 6. What to do next

1. **The user looks at the editor and types in it.** Phases 2 and 3 meet their "done when"
   by measurement and tests only. The hand checks in section 4 come first, on the Turkish
   layout.
2. **A New file command** (untitled documents: `Doc::path` becomes optional, Save falls through
   to Save as). It was left out of phases 2 and 3 and an editor needs it.
3. Then the feature roadmap in `docs/PLAN.md`, in its order: editing basics (duplicate, move and
   delete line, toggle comment, change case, trim trailing spaces, tabs to spaces), then find and
   replace, then unsaved-session restore.
4. The Files pane could follow changes in its folders with the shared watcher's new
   `set_folders` and the tree's `watched_dirs` (shared commit `e93719b`).
5. Any change to shared code: edit it in `markdown-shared-rs`, run the viewer's check (section 7),
   push, then move the `rev` in both applications.
6. Code the editor's shell copied from the viewer because it was generic but had not been moved
   (parts of the window loop, the bar, the find box wiring) is the input for step 4 of the shared
   plan.

## 7. Build and check

```bash
# in this repository; on the PC, keep temp files off the system drive's temp folder
export TEMP="$PWD/target/tmp" TMP="$PWD/target/tmp"; mkdir -p target/tmp
cargo build --release --workspace
cargo test --release --workspace        # 207 passed on 2026-11-13
cargo clippy --release --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all --check
bash tests/shots.sh target/shots/a      # 35 PNGs, deterministic; first run generates target/data
```

Useful flags of `mdedit.exe` (all in `bins/mdedit/src/args.rs`): `--no-session`, `--shot out.png`
with `--size WxH --scale N --light|--dark --menu NAME --dialog NAME --find TEXT --goto L[:C]
--select A-B --type TEXT --scroll N --hscroll N --hover X,Y`; `--trace` prints stage times, first
frame, memory and CPU time; `--scroll-steps N` times scroll frames; `--type-steps N` types N
keystrokes at the caret and times each from keystroke to pixels (it exits without saving);
`--exit-after-ms N` opens a real window and closes it.

```bash
target/release/mdedit.exe --no-session --trace --exit-after-ms 2500 fixtures/sample.rs
target/release/mdedit.exe --no-session --trace --exit-after-ms 2500 target/data/100mb.txt
target/release/mdedit.exe --no-session --trace --type-steps 300 --goto 20:5 fixtures/sample.rs
```

**The viewer's no-pixel-change check.** The script and its baseline lived in a session scratch
folder on the PC and are not in any repository. To recreate it: in the viewer, at a commit known
to be good, render a fixed set of `--no-session --shot` states (both themes, each `--menu`, each
`--dialog`, the empty state, panes, find, focus mode, page widths, scales 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0, a few
`--hover` positions; 43 were used) into a baseline folder; after a change, render again and `cmp`
every file, then run the workspace tests (which include the four goldens) and `cargo fmt --check`.
Putting that script into the viewer's repository would be a useful first task.

Fixtures are written with exact bytes by `fixtures/make_fixtures.py`; `.gitattributes` keeps git
from converting them.
